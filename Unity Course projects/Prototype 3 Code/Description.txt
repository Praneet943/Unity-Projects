This project was developed during the official Unity programming course. It is a game where a player runs and has to jump over obstacles, if the player hits any of them, it
is game over. PlayerController will control the plater, RepeatingBackground will repeat the backround so it looks like the background keeps on going as the game plays out.
SpawnManager will spawn the obstacles, MoveLeft will stop the background from moving if the game is over.

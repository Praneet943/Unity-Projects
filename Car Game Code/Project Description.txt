
This project contains the code for the first Unity project I made. The project is a car game where the user goes around the track and there is a lap counting mechanism 
where each time the user crosses the finish line, the laps increment, there is also a mechanism to make sure that the user goes fully around the course and does not cheat.

CarMoving.cs is the main car controller which controls the car's movements.

HalfwayTrigger.cs and LineCrossed.cs are code for making sure the user does not cheat by using shortcuts.
